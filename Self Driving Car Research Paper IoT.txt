Self Driving Car Research Paper IoT Assignment
Abstract:
achieve low cost and low power
user a calm and stress free driving
h it will detect
the obstacle, record the image for few seconds store it in cloud drop box for future use and also alert message is given to the user
navigates itself on the track, control the movements and also check the surroundings with the help of Ultrasonic sensors
input taken from sensors given to RPi
RPi to motor commands
1 Introduction:
A robotic automotive is an automatic vehicle that's designed to travel between destinations with none human intervention.
1.24 million individuals have been killed in roads 
safety: cant get drunk/fuzzy
congestion: frustration causes accidents and illogical actions
value shopping: not understood
parking: automatic parking
2 Literature Survey
Parth Verma-The google car-read map instructions-reduce human error+ accident
shortcoming: speed unable to detect obstracles >100mph
Michal Ruziicka and Peter Masek-Real Time Visual Maker Detector and huntsman
supported pc Vision for Semi-autonomous Convoy
Purpose - dominant the semiautonomous convoy by coming up with vision methodology -
low power consumption and economical product value - 320x240 low resolution of captured frames
which can cause the result inaccurate. Higher resolution
cannot be used because of low value power device that
doesn’t act in real time process thanks to low frame
M. Naveen Kumar - “OpenCV for
Computer Vision Applications-substance of an image- contains low
level picture preparing capacities and elevated level
calculations for tracking location, highlight coordinating and
following-
The principle utilization of IR sensors in mechanical
autonomy- IR sensor is for obstruction evasion.- Measure separations with
decreased reaction times merits examining. In this paper,
another IR sensor dependent on the light power-
Mirjana Maksimovic-"Raspberry Pi
as Internet of Things equipment: Performances and
Constraints".-customizable and programmable, compact
“Autonomous machine robot with laptop vision system- s several options like GPS,
measuring device and compass which may use for
information collections purposes higher accuracy results
achieved with higher resolution and frequency- robot cant operate in dark
3 Problem Statement
autonomous cars limited
sensing technology
intervention, accident liability authority, less security,
Wireless range is too small, No video surveillance system
doesn’t work safely in some weather condition and crowd
navigation.
4) Objectives
To analyze and design an automated car model, which
endured few of the above stated flaws by using a GUI based
control for movement of the automated car model and video
surveillance so that the user gets an idea of what is present in
the way of travel of the automated car
obstacle is detected in forward motion a
video is recorded and stored in cloud drop box and if an
obstacle in detected at backward then an alert message is
sent to user. 
It helps to reduce the memory load, Video surveillance is
implemented, Wireless range is increased, it also produce
low cost and low power consumption autonomous car. The
main goal of self-driving automated car is to avoid
accidents.
